        # However, `custom_id` based persistence is possible.
        # I'll simple register a generic ReviewView handler that catches the pattern? 
        # No, `add_view` needs an instance.
        # I will create a factory ReviewView that can handle any user_id if I parse it from custom_id?
        # No, Interaction dispatch regex is not built-in easily.
        # I'll just skip complex persistence restoration for now, assuming high uptime or admin can handle legacy manually. 
        # Wait, the user requirement "make it good and keep all perfect" suggests I should try.
        # Code: `self.bot.add_view(PersistentReviewView(self.bot))` where PersistentReviewView buttons have known custom_ids but I need unique user IDs.
        # The standard solution is to use `custom_id="staff_app:accept:12345"` and a `Item` with dynamic callback?
        # Actually, if I use `self.bot.add_view(ReviewView(user_id=0, bot=self.bot))` logic? No.

        # Simply: Don't use `discord.ui.button` decorator for dynamic IDs if we want persistence easily without restoring all.
